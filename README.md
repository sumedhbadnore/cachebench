# CacheBench

**CacheBench** is a web app to simulate cache replacement policies on request traces.  
It reports hit/miss counts, hit rate, and average latency, with interactive visualizations.  
Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

---

### How It Works

Paste a trace like A B A C A D, choose a policy (LRU, FIFO, LFU), and set a cache capacity.
The app simulates cache behavior and reports:

- Hits & Misses

- Hit rate (%)

- Average latency (default: hit = 1 ms, miss = 20 ms)

---

### Features

Paste a trace like A B A C A D, choose a policy (LRU, FIFO, LFU), and set a cache capacity.
The app simulates cache behavior and reports:

- Controls: Enter parameters and traces, then run simulations.

- Results: View metrics, charts, and export CSV.

- Capacity Sweep: Run multiple capacities to visualize hit rate vs cache size.

---

### Parameters

- Policy

- LRU: Evicts least recently used items.

- FIFO: Evicts items in insertion order.

- LFU: Evicts least frequently used items.

- Capacity: Number of entries the cache can hold.

- Cache Latency (ms): Time cost for a hit (default = 1).

- Miss Latency (ms): Time cost for a miss (default = 20).

- Warmup Accesses: Initial requests used to fill the cache but excluded from metrics (reduces cold start noise).

---

### Example Traces

These examples highlight policy differences (set warmup=0):

- Recency wins â†’ LRU outperforms FIFO (capacity = 3)

```
A B C A D A B C A D A B C A D
```

- Scan after hot set â†’ LFU excels (capacity = 3)

```
A B C repeated, then Dâ€“M, then back to A B C
```

- Phase shift â†’ LRU adapts better, LFU struggles (capacity = 3)

```
A B C repeated, then D E F repeated
```
